    <p class="exp-description">
      I had the opportunity to work at Accenture as an Application Development Analyst. I had a lot of interesting projects and learned a lot of new skills. The culture was great, people were very open.
      It was really cool to see how everything works together in order to create a successful project.
      The first project that I worked on is for a social welfare program for a state in the U.S, we were working with the program’s management for this. We developed an automated SMS system along with a webchat to decrease the churn in client registration and return higher yield of client membership to the program. It was really interesting because we got insights from both sides, which helped us develop a better product overall!

      <img class="qa-picture" src="images\crowdsourcing-history.jpg">
      <p class="exp-description">
        While I was working overseas in Qatar as a Maintenance Technician I took a part time job of being a manual software tester.
        Work experience is essential for any job, it can be difficult to get a job if you don't have experience, so doing a part time job will help you build your resume and show future employers that you are qualified. I have registered with several crowdsourcing websites whose service is centered on software testing.
        Crowdsourcing is a process that involves outsourcing tasks to a large group of people, usually via the internet. The idea behind crowdsourcing is that there are many people out there who have time and skills that can be utilized to complete tasks.
        The use of crowdsourcing websites has grown over the years because it is an efficient way to get the job done without having to spend money on hiring someone else. There are many different ways in which you can use these sites, but they all have one thing in common: they provide access to people with skills and time.
        I have tested games, applications and websites for companies like Testbirds and TestIO. 
        Testbirds is a company that hires testers on a freelance basis. They have tests for various platforms such as IOS, Android, and Windows. The testers work from home and get paid per project which ranges from $15-$30 per hour depending on the complexity of the test.
        TestIO offers an opportunity for people to sign up for a part time job where they can earn up to $100 per hour by testing software products. Their tests range from mobile apps, web applications, game apps, and more!

    My tasks here includes conducting routine inspections and providing on-site support at customer locations throughout the region. The Maintenance Technician will also provide assistance with field service repairs, installation and training on products sold by Lodige Systems. Maintenance technicians are responsible for the day-to-day operations of equipment. Their duties include cleaning, inspecting, checking, and repairing machinery.
